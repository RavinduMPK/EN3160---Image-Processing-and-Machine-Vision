# Assignment: Intensity Transformations and Neighborhood Filtering

This repository contains my solutions to the "EN3160 Assignment 1" on Intensity Transformations and Neighborhood Filtering.

## Assignment Overview

1. **Intensity Transformation:** Implemented the intensity transformation depicted in Fig. 1a on the image shown in Fig. 1b.

2. **Accentuating Brain Matter:** Applied a similar operation as above to accentuate white matter and gray matter in a brain proton density image.

3. **Gamma Correction:** Applied gamma correction to an image in the L*a*b* color space and displayed histograms before and after correction.

4. **Enhancing Vibrance:** Increased the vibrance of a photograph using an intensity transformation on the saturation plane.

5. **Histogram Equalization:** Implemented histogram equalization on an image and displayed histograms before and after equalization.

6. **Histogram Equalization on Foreground:** Applied histogram equalization only to the foreground of an image.

7. **Sobel Filtering:** Carried out Sobel filtering using different methods.

8. **Image Zooming:** Implemented image zooming with nearest-neighbor and bilinear interpolation.

9. **Image Segmentation:** Used grabCut to segment an image and enhanced it with a blurred background.
